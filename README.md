# 🚗 MPG Prediction Using Decision Trees 🌳

Predict a vehicle's MPG (miles per gallon) using a Decision Tree Regressor based on features like horsepower, weight, cylinders, acceleration, model year, and origin. Includes a graph comparing predicted vs actual MPG! 📊

## 📝 Project Overview
This project uses a decision tree to predict fuel efficiency. The model learns from vehicle features and predicts MPG, helping analyze which factors most influence fuel consumption.  

## ✨ Features
- Predicts MPG based on:
  - 🏎️ Cylinders
  - ⚡ Horsepower
  - ⚖️ Weight
  - ⏱️ Acceleration
  - 📅 Model year
  - 🌍 Origin
- Compares predicted vs actual MPG with a scatter plot using matplotlib 📊
- Evaluates model accuracy with RMSE and R² metrics 📏

## 📂 Dataset
Uses `auto-mpg.csv`, containing MPG and vehicle specifications. Missing values are handled automatically.
